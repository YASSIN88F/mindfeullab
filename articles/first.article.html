  <h1>The Science of a Perfect Morning Routine</h1>

  <p>Many successful people attribute their productivity and clarity to a powerful morning routine. But what does science say about the best way to start your day?</p>

  <p>Research in neuroscience suggests that beginning your morning with natural light exposure, light exercise, and mindful planning can set the tone for optimal mental performance. Avoid checking your phone immediately, and instead, engage in activities that nourish your mind and body.</p>

  <p>This approach helps regulate your circadian rhythm, boosts dopamine and serotonin levels, and prepares your brain for complex tasks.</p>

  <p>By crafting a deliberate and consistent morning habit, you're not just reacting to the day—you're leading it.</p>
